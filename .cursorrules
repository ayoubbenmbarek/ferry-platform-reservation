# Maritime Reservation Website Development - Professional Prompt

## Project Overview
I need to develop a professional maritime reservation website for a Tunisian travel agency that specializes in ferry bookings between Italy/France and Tunisia. The website should integrate with multiple ferry operators' APIs and provide a complete booking experience.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Ferry Operators Integration
- **Primary operators**: CTN (Compagnie Tunisienne de Navigation), Danel Casanova, GNV (Grandi Navi Veloci), Corsica Lines
- **Secondary operators**: Consider additional operators serving Italy-Tunisia and France-Tunisia routes
- Integrate with their booking APIs for real-time availability, pricing, and reservations
- Handle different API formats and authentication methods

### 2. Route Coverage
- **Italy to Tunisia**: Genoa-Tunis, Civitavecchia-Tunis, Palermo-Tunis, Salerno-Tunis
- **France to Tunisia**: Marseille-Tunis, Nice-Tunis
- **Return routes**: All corresponding Tunisia to Italy/France routes
- Display route maps and journey information

### 3. Booking Features
- **Search functionality**: Date, route, passenger count, vehicle options
- **Real-time availability**: Live ferry schedules and capacity
- **Multi-passenger booking**: Different passenger types (adult, child, infant)
- **Vehicle booking**: Cars, motorcycles, campers with dimensions
- **Cabin selection**: Different cabin types and deck levels
- **Seat selection**: Where applicable
- **Price comparison**: Between different operators and sailing times

### 4. Payment Processing
- **Multiple payment methods**: Credit cards, PayPal, bank transfers
- **Secure payment gateway**: PCI DSS compliant
- **Multi-currency support**: EUR, TND (Tunisian Dinar), USD
- **Payment confirmation**: Instant confirmation and receipts

### 5. User Experience
- **Multilingual support**: Arabic, French, Italian, English
- **Responsive design**: Mobile-first approach
- **User accounts**: Registration, login, booking history
- **Guest booking**: Option to book without registration
- **Email notifications**: Booking confirmations, reminders, updates

## Technical Specifications

### Backend (Python)
- **Framework**: FastAPI or Django REST Framework
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for production, SQLite for development
- **API Integration**: Requests library for ferry operator APIs
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens for user sessions
- **Payment**: Stripe or similar payment processor integration
- **Email**: SMTP integration for notifications
- **Caching**: Redis for API response caching
- **Task Queue**: Celery for background tasks (booking confirmations, email sending)

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React.js with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS or Material-UI
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit or Zustand
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with validation
- **API Calls**: Axios or React Query
- **Routing**: React Router
- **Internationalization**: i18next for multilingual support

### Infrastructure
- **Hosting**: AWS, DigitalOcean, or similar cloud provider
- **Database**: Managed PostgreSQL service
- **CDN**: CloudFront or similar for static assets
- **SSL**: Let's Encrypt or CloudFlare SSL
- **Monitoring**: Application and infrastructure monitoring
- **Backup**: Automated database backups

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
- Set up development environment
- Create project structure
- Implement basic API endpoints
- Set up database schema
- Create basic React application structure

### Phase 2: Core Features (Weeks 3-5)
- Implement search functionality
- Integrate with first ferry operator API
- Develop booking flow
- Create user authentication system
- Build responsive UI components

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Weeks 6-8)
- Integrate remaining ferry operators
- Implement payment processing
- Add multilingual support
- Develop admin dashboard
- Create email notification system

### Phase 4: Testing & Optimization (Weeks 9-10)
- Comprehensive testing (unit, integration, e2e)
- Performance optimization
- Security audit
- Load testing
- Bug fixes and refinements

### Phase 5: Deployment & Launch (Weeks 11-12)
- Production deployment
- DNS configuration
- SSL certificate setup
- Monitoring implementation
- User training and documentation

## Security Considerations
- **Data encryption**: All sensitive data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **API security**: Rate limiting, API key management
- **Payment security**: PCI DSS compliance
- **User data protection**: GDPR compliance for EU users
- **Input validation**: Comprehensive validation on all user inputs
- **Authentication**: Secure password policies and session management

## Performance Requirements
- **Page load time**: < 3 seconds for main pages
- **API response time**: < 2 seconds for search results
- **Concurrent users**: Support for 500+ simultaneous users
- **Uptime**: 99.9% availability target
- **Mobile performance**: Optimized for mobile devices

## Specific Development Requests

1. **Create a detailed project structure** with all necessary files and folders
2. **Implement API integration patterns** that can be easily extended for new ferry operators
3. **Design a flexible booking system** that handles different operator requirements
4. **Build a comprehensive admin dashboard** for managing bookings and monitoring
5. **Implement robust error handling** for API failures and edge cases
6. **Create detailed documentation** for API endpoints and system architecture
7. **Set up automated testing** for critical booking flows
8. **Implement logging and monitoring** for production deployment

## Additional Features to Consider
- **Loyalty program**: Points system for frequent customers
- **Group bookings**: Special rates for group reservations
- **Mobile app**: React Native version for mobile users
- **Analytics**: Booking trends and customer behavior analysis
- **Customer support**: Live chat integration
- **Promotional codes**: Discount and coupon system
- **Weather integration**: Ferry schedule updates based on weather conditions

## Business Logic Considerations
- **Booking holds**: Temporary reservations while payment is processed
- **Cancellation policy**: Different policies per operator
- **Refund processing**: Automated refund handling
- **Overbooking protection**: Prevent double bookings
- **Dynamic pricing**: Integration with operator pricing models
- **Commission tracking**: Agency commission calculation and reporting

Please provide a complete implementation plan with code examples, detailed architecture diagrams, database schemas, and step-by-step development instructions. Include best practices for API integration, error handling, and production deployment.
