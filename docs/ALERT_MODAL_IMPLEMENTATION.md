# Availability Alert Modal Implementation

## Overview
Replaced the basic `window.prompt()` for email collection with an elegant modal dialog that automatically uses the logged-in user's email.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Component: AvailabilityAlertModal.tsx
**Location**: `/frontend/src/components/AvailabilityAlertModal.tsx`

**Features**:
- ✅ Elegant modal design matching the existing AvailabilityAlertButton style
- ✅ Automatically pre-fills email for logged-in users
- ✅ Email input is read-only when user is authenticated
- ✅ Shows helpful tip for non-authenticated users to sign in
- ✅ Displays comprehensive ferry and route information:
  - Ferry operator (e.g., CTN, GNV)
  - Sailing time (e.g., 19:00)
  - Route (departure → arrival)
  - Date and passenger count
  - Vehicle info (if applicable)
- ✅ Smooth animations (fadeIn, slideDown)
- ✅ Loading states with spinner
- ✅ Success/error message handling
- ✅ Auto-closes after successful alert creation

**Key Props**:
```typescript
interface AlertModalProps {
  isOpen: boolean;
  onClose: () => void;
  ferry: FerryInfo | null;
  alertType: 'passenger' | 'vehicle' | 'cabin';
  searchParams: SearchParams;
  isSelectingReturn: boolean;
  onSuccess?: (message: string) => void;
}
```

### 2. Updated: NewSearchPage.tsx
**Location**: `/frontend/src/pages/NewSearchPage.tsx`

**Changes**:
1. Added import for new `AvailabilityAlertModal` component
2. Removed unused imports (`api` from services)
3. Added state management for modal:
   ```typescript
   const [showAlertModal, setShowAlertModal] = useState(false);
   const [selectedAlertFerry, setSelectedAlertFerry] = useState<FerryResult | null>(null);
   const [selectedAlertType, setSelectedAlertType] = useState<'passenger' | 'vehicle' | 'cabin'>('passenger');
   ```
4. Removed `creatingAlert` state (no longer needed)
5. Simplified `handleCreateAlert` function to just open modal:
   ```typescript
   const handleCreateAlert = (
     ferry: FerryResult,
     alertType: 'passenger' | 'vehicle' | 'cabin'
   ) => {
     setSelectedAlertFerry(ferry);
     setSelectedAlertType(alertType);
     setShowAlertModal(true);
   };
   ```
6. Added `handleAlertSuccess` callback for toast notifications
7. Removed disabled/loading states from all "🔔 Notify" buttons (now handled by modal)
8. Added modal component to JSX (after toast notification)

### 3. Updated: index.css
**Location**: `/frontend/src/index.css`

**Changes**:
Added slideDown animation for smooth alert messages:
```css
@keyframes slideDown {
  from {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: translateY(-10px);
  }
  to {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: translateY(0);
  }
}

.animate-slideDown {
  animation: slideDown 0.3s ease-out;
}
```

## User Experience Improvements

### For Logged-In Users:
1. Click "🔔 Notify" button on any availability badge
2. Modal opens with email **automatically pre-filled** from their account
3. Email field is **read-only** (cannot be changed)
4. Shows green indicator: "(from your account)"
5. User just needs to click "🔔 Create Alert" - no typing required!

### For Non-Logged-In Users:
1. Click "🔔 Notify" button on any availability badge
2. Modal opens with **empty email field**
3. User enters their email address
4. Shows helpful tip: "💡 Tip: Sign in to automatically use your account email"
5. Validates email has '@' character
6. Click "🔔 Create Alert"

### For All Users:
- See comprehensive ferry information before confirming alert
- Clear visual feedback during alert creation (loading spinner)
- Success message with auto-close after 1.5 seconds
- Error messages displayed inline if creation fails
- Can cancel at any time by clicking Cancel or X

## Technical Details

### Authentication Integration
The modal uses Redux `useSelector` to access the auth state:
```typescript
const { user, isAuthenticated } = useSelector((state: RootState) => state.auth);
```

When authenticated:
- `user.email` is automatically used
- Email input becomes read-only
- Shows "(from your account)" indicator

### State Management
- Modal visibility controlled by `showAlertModal` state
- Ferry info and alert type stored when user clicks Notify
- Toast message shown on success via callback
- Modal state resets when closed

### Error Handling
- Email validation (checks for '@')
- API error messages displayed in modal
- Network errors gracefully handled
- User stays in modal if error occurs (can retry)

  What it deletes: User-created price alert
  subscriptions

  # Deletes from: PriceAlert table
  # Condition: status = CANCELLED or 
  EXPIRED, older than 180 days

  Example: When a user sets up "Notify me
  when Tunis→Marseille drops below €80" -
  this alert record gets cleaned up after it
   expires/cancels.

  What it deletes: System price tracking
  data for analytics

  # Deletes from 3 tables:
  # 1. PriceHistory - historical price 
  snapshots (older than 180 days)
  # 2. PricePrediction - AI price 
  predictions (older than 180 days)  
  # 3. FareCalendarCache - cached fare 
  calendar data (expired entries)

  Example: Every 6 hours, the system records
   prices for all routes. This data is used
  for price trends, predictions, and the
  fare calendar. Old data gets cleaned up.
